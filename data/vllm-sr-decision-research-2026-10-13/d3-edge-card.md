# d3-edge

**d3-edge** is the 0.6B multimodal foundation decision model of Decision 3.0, the decision models of [vLLM Semantic Router](https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router). Give it an input (text or JSON, optionally with images and videos) and the questions you need answered: pick one of several options, say yes or no, or rate on a scale. It answers them all in one call and returns a probability for every answer, without generating text.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Parameters** | 0.59B, including the 0.10B vision encoder |
| **Inputs** | Text or JSON, plus images and videos (several per request) |
| **Decision types** | Choice · Yes / No · Score |
| **License** | Apache-2.0 |

## Highlights

- **Jev Decision Index 0.3.2: 20.2 on the official text board**, second among the entries of similar size; public suite 28.82, measured with the official 0.3 kit on the released weights: all 140,178 public requests answered, none unsupported.
- **+6.6 over Decision 2.0** (its 0.6B model: 13.6 on the official board): +12.1 on the public suite, ahead in all five of its areas, and +7.4 and +1.1 on the private same-skill tests and new-domain tasks.
- **Reads images:** multiple images per request (PNG, JPEG or WebP), given as paths, URLs, PIL images or base64 data URLs; every question of the request sees all of them.
- **Reads videos:** multiple videos per request (MP4, WebM, MOV or MKV), given as paths, URLs, base64 data URLs or frame arrays, read at 2 frames per second; **Perception Test (multiple-choice video QA): 46.6** (internal evaluation).
- **Speed:** a median of 6.6 ms for a text request, 58.6 ms for a request with an image and 274 ms for a request with a 10-second video, on one AMD Instinct MI325X GPU, one request at a time with AutoModel.
- **Serving:** 861 requests/s with p99 under 1 s on one AMD Instinct MI325X with vLLM Semantic Router, 6.1× AutoModel (one-question text, `batching` profile); the default `exact` profile gives AutoModel's answers byte for byte when both use the same kernel settings ([Serving performance](#serving-performance)).
- **Many questions, one call:** Choice, Yes / No and Score questions about the same input are answered together, each from its own forward pass over the input, with a probability for every option.

# Or as a pipeline:

```

Images go before the text of the request, each read at up to 1.6 megapixels; videos follow the images, read at 2 frames per second (at most 32 frames spread over the whole video, each at up to 0.2 megapixels). Every question of the request sees all of them.

## Run with vLLM Semantic Router

[vLLM Semantic Router](https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router) serves Decision 3.0 natively in Engine mode, which runs one model behind the System One API on your own machine. Its answers match this package's own `d3_server.py` exactly, for text, images and videos (measured on AMD Instinct MI325X).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vllm-sr.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --channel dev --no-launch
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
vllm-sr serve -e vllm-sr/d3-edge
```

The platform is detected automatically; choose one with `--platform auto|cpu|cuda|rocm` (default `auto`).

Engine mode and Decision 3.0 are in the development channel (`--channel dev`) until a stable vLLM Semantic Router release includes them. The first start pulls the image for your machine and downloads the model. Then ask questions about a request:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8899/v1/systemone -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "model": "vllm-sr/d3-edge",
  "state": "Write a Python function that merges two sorted lists.",
  "questions": {
    "kind": {"type": "choice", "instructions": "What kind of work is this?",
             "criteria": {"code": "Writing or fixing code", "math": "Mathematics", "chat": "Anything else"}},
    "reasoning": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "Does answering this need multi-step reasoning?"}
  }
}'
```

Send images as base64 data URLs (PNG, JPEG or WebP) in `images` and videos (MP4, WebM, QuickTime or Matroska) in `videos`; every question sees them:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8899/v1/systemone -H 'content-type: application/json' --data-binary @- <<EOF
{
  "model": "vllm-sr/d3-edge",
  "state": "What does the attached image show?",
  "images": ["data:image/png;base64,$(base64 -w0 chart.png)"],
  "questions": {
    "kind": {"type": "choice", "instructions": "What kind of image is this?",
             "criteria": {"chart": "A chart or plot", "photo": "A photograph", "document": "A document"}}
  }
}
EOF
```

```bash
curl -s localhost:8899/v1/systemone -H 'content-type: application/json' --data-binary @- <<EOF
{
  "model": "vllm-sr/d3-edge",
  "state": "What happens in the clip?",
  "videos": ["data:video/mp4;base64,$(base64 -w0 clip.mp4)"],
  "questions": {
    "moving": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "Does something move across the scene?"}
  }
}
EOF
```

`vllm-sr stop` stops it. See [Router and Engine modes](https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router/blob/main/src/vllm-sr/INSTANCE_MODES.md#ask-about-images-and-videos) for limits and options.

### Serving performance

**On one AMD Instinct MI325X, vLLM Semantic Router serves d3-edge at 861 requests/s with p99 under 1 s, 6.1× AutoModel** (one-question text, `batching` profile), and its default `exact` profile gives AutoModel's answers byte for byte when both use the same kernel settings.

![Serving throughput of d3-edge on one AMD Instinct MI325X: AutoModel, the package server and vLLM Semantic Router Engine mode](assets/serving-throughput.png)

AutoModel runs in your own process, one call at a time (the Quickstart code); the package server is its `python d3_server.py`; Engine mode is `vllm-sr serve -e` with its default `exact` profile, or with `--runtime-profile batching`.

Where Engine mode helps, and what it costs:

- **Throughput:** 6.1× AutoModel's requests per second on one-question text, 5.0× on 8-question images and 2.4× on 10-second videos, with the better Engine profile of each row.
- **Start-up:** the first answer comes 11.6 s after launch with empty kernel caches, against 24.9 s for AutoModel, whose first image then takes another 1.13 s, and 36.5 s for the package server.
- **Many questions and long inputs:** one request at a time, Engine mode (`exact`) answers 16 text questions in 21.4 ms (AutoModel: 22.4 ms), 8 questions about one image in 215 ms (267 ms) and a 32k-token text in 268 ms (281 ms); `batching` runs the 8 image questions together in 111 ms, 58 % less than AutoModel.
- **GPU memory:** 15.9 GiB per replica at peak with `exact`, above the package server's 12.1 GiB, and 19.9 GiB with `batching`; AutoModel, serving one request at a time, peaked at 5.2 GiB. Engine mode keeps up to 2 GiB of image features cached.
- **Answers:** Engine mode (`exact`) returned answers byte-identical to AutoModel's on all 7 request types (text with 1, 4 or 16 questions, an image with 1 or 8, the video and a 32k-token text) when AutoModel used the same kernel settings: 140 Engine replies and 21 AutoModel calls compared. With the kernel autotuning AutoModel runs in each new process, 6 of the 7 were byte-identical and no decision changed (largest probability difference 0.009). `batching` changed 0.151 % of decisions on the complete public suite (487 of 323,259 questions, near-ties), with gold accuracy 61.702 → 61.694 % and the index 28.82 → 28.82.

A single short request is fastest in your own process: AutoModel answers one text question 1.3 ms sooner than Engine mode and one new image 26 ms sooner, the cost of going through the router to the model worker and its media path. Engine mode's gains come from serving many requests at once.
